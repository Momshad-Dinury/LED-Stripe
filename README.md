# LED-Stripe
Creating Rainbow effect and many other color combo using LED-Stripe

This LED stripe is controlled via MQTTdash board app. We initiate different modes by sending command to LED stripe via MQTT protocol.
For internet connectivity I am using NodeMCU [ESP8266v2].
The LED stripe needs external power to provide that I used a 5v supply.

By combining all these I made a MQTT protocol controlled LED stripe that controlled via a free application of MQTT
